        There are two ways to get artist access! If you know somebody who already has artist access, they
        can invite you via their Settings page (or via the concert creation page if
        you have a show coming up together). If not, go to your
        <a class="link" href="{% url 'findshows:user_settings' %}">Settings</a> page
        and click <em>Request Artist Access</em>. You will need to provide your artist
        name, as well as a website or social media account where we can contact
        you to verify your identity. A mod will review the request and reach out
        as soon as possible.
        {% endaccordion_element %}

        {% accordion_element title="&hellip;post a show?" %}
        Log in; from the menu, go to your
        <a class="link" href="{% url 'findshows:artist_dashboard' %}">artist dashboard</a>
        and click <em>Create new show listing</em>.
        {% endaccordion_element %}

        {% accordion_element title="&hellip;edit a show I'm a part of?" %}
        Only the user who initially created a show can edit it. Log in; from the menu, go to your
        <a class="link" href="{% url 'findshows:artist_dashboard' %}">artist dashboard</a>.
        If you created a show, it should have an <em>Edit</em> button next to it. If
        you just want to edit your artist info it appears on the concert listing,
        you can do that by editing your artist profile (also from the dashboard).
        {% endaccordion_element %}

        {% accordion_element title="&hellip;delete/cancel a show I'm a part of?" %}
        Only the user who initially created a show can cancel it. Log in; from the menu, go to your
        <a class="link" href="{% url 'findshows:artist_dashboard' %}">artist dashboard</a>.
        If you created a show, it should have a <em>Cancel</em> button next to it. The concert's
        detail page will now display prominently the fact that it is cancelled, and it will no
        longer show up anywhere else (search, artist pages, emails). You cannot delete a show.
        {% endaccordion_element %}
        
        {% accordion_element title="&hellip;give a bandmate/manager access to list shows?" %}
        Multiple users can manage the same artist. Log in; from the menu, go to your
        <a class="link" href="{% url 'findshows:artist_dashboard' %}">artist dashboard</a>.
        Click <em>Manage access</em> under the relevant artist, enter the email of the person to whom you'd like to
        give access, click <em>Add</em>, then <em>Submit</em>.
