## Initial Setup

By this point in the setup, you should have a username and password to log into
the site. Do so, and click the menu in the upper right and navigate to the Admin
Site. Click **Custom Texts**, then use the **Add custom text +** button in the upper
right repeatedly to create the following records:

| Type                            | Text                                                                            |
|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| About page                      | This is the text that will appear on the About page of your site.               |
| Site title                      | This will appear at the top of your site and emails, e.g. ChicagoLocalMusic.net |
| Subject for weekly email        | The subject of the weekly recommendation email                                  |
| Header message for weekly email | Text at the top of the weekly recommendation email; you can update this if you want it to change every week, leave it the same, or leave it blank. |

The other type, Warning/announcement banner, displays a banner at the top of the home page of the site to display messages for planned downtime or anything like that.

## Invite Artists

Navigate to the home page of the site. To invite an artist to create a profile
and list shows (including yourself), click the menu in the upper right and
select **Mod Dashboard**. From there, click the **Invite Artist** button. 

Don't forget to check the **Local** box to give permission to post shows. If the
artist already has an account, make sure to enter the email address associated
with their account.
