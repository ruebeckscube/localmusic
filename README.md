# The localmusic project

We aim to make local music more discoverable and accessible, with minimal
demands on your attention (one email a week! or on-demand on the website) and
minimal dependence on the big social media platforms. You can discover shows on
your own by sampling artists' music with one click, or use our recommendation
system (always optional and user-controlled) powered by the open-source [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/)
database.

Artists post their own shows and create their own profiles&mdash; The project is
free as in freedom, free as in beer for self-hosting, and open-source. To get
started, see [self-hosting instructions](/docs/self-hosting.md).
